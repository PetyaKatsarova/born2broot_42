AppArmor is a security framework in Debian that allows for the confinement of processes to specific resources, such as files or network sockets, in order to limit their potential for causing harm. It provides an additional layer of security to the operating system by defining and enforcing policies that restrict the actions that processes can take, thereby reducing the risk of security vulnerabilities being exploited.


**************** # **CONFIG THE VM** ************************

Part 4.1 - Installing Sudo

su - to login in as the root user

apt-get update -y

apt-get upgrade -y

You can uninstall all the listed packages by running the following command as root:

apt-get remove mariadb-client-10.5 mariadb-common mariadb-server-10.5
If you also want to remove the configuration files for these packages, run the following command instead:

apt-get remove --purge mariadb-client-10.5 mariadb-common mariadb-server-10.5
This will remove the packages and their configuration files, but will not remove the data files stored in the databases. To remove the data files, you will need to manually delete the directories in which they are stored.

how to check if i have uninstalled lighttpd
To check if you have uninstalled Lighttpd on Debian, you can use the following command:

dpkg -l | grep lighttpd
This will return information about all installed packages that have the word "lighttpd" in their name. If Lighttpd is not installed, the command will return an empty result. You can also check the Lighttpd service status using the following command:

systemctl status lighttpd
This should return a message indicating that the service is not found, indicating that Lighttpd has been successfully uninstalled.

how to uninstall those: ii  lighttpd                       1.4.59-1+deb11u2               amd64        fast webserver with minimal memory footprint
ii  lighttpd-mod-deflate           1.4.59-1+deb11u2               amd64        HTTP response compression module for lighttpd
ii  lighttpd-mod-openssl           1.4.59-1+deb11u2               amd64        TLS support using OpenSSL module for lighttpd
To uninstall Lighttpd and its related packages in Debian, you can use the following command:

sudo apt-get remove lighttpd lighttpd-mod-deflate lighttpd-mod-openssl
This will remove the Lighttpd web server, the mod_deflate module for HTTP response compression, and the mod_openssl module for TLS support. Note that apt-get remove only removes the packages, but retains the configuration files. If you want to remove both the packages and their configuration files, you can use the purge option:

sudo apt-get remove --purge lighttpd lighttpd-mod-deflate lighttpd-mod-openssl

how to uninstall apache2 and dependencies
To uninstall Apache2 and its dependencies on Debian, you can use the following command:

sudo apt-get remove apache2
This command will remove Apache2 and its associated packages, but it will not remove the configuration files or any data stored in the web root directory. If you want to completely remove Apache2, including its configuration files, you can use the following command instead:

sudo apt-get --purge remove apache2
Note: Before uninstalling Apache2, make sure that there is no critical data stored in the web root directory or in the Apache configuration files. It's always a good idea to backup any important data before making changes to your system.

how to set up on my vm on debian: â€¢ Set up a functional WordPress website with the following services: lighttpd, MariaDB, and PHP. 
To set up a functional WordPress website with lighttpd, MariaDB, and PHP on a Debian-based system, you can follow these steps:

Install lighttpd, MariaDB, and PHP:
sql
Copy code
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install lighttpd mariadb-server mariadb-client php7.4-fpm php7.4-mysql
Start and enable the lighttpd and mariadb services:
bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl start lighttpd
sudo systemctl enable lighttpd
sudo systemctl start mariadb
sudo systemctl enable mariadb
Secure the MariaDB installation:
Copy code
sudo mysql_secure_installation
Create a database and a user for WordPress:
css
Copy code
sudo mysql -u root -p
sql
Copy code
CREATE DATABASE wordpress DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci;
CREATE USER 'wpuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON wordpress.* TO 'wpuser'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EXIT;
Download and extract the latest version of WordPress:

wget https://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz
tar -xzvf latest.tar.gz
Copy the extracted files to the document root directory of lighttpd:

sudo cp -r wordpress /var/www/html/
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/wordpress
Configure lighttpd to work with PHP-FPM:

sudo nano /etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf
Add the following line in the lighttpd.conf file:

include "conf-available/15-fastcgi-php.conf"
Restart lighttpd:

sudo systemctl restart lighttpd
Access the WordPress installation page in a web browser using the IP address or hostname of the server. The setup process should guide you through the rest of the installation process.
These are the basic steps to set up a functional WordPress website with lighttpd, MariaDB, and PHP on a Debian-based system.

****************** MARIADB ********************
mysql -u root -p
// WHEN in mysql shell: 
SHOW DATABASES
SELECT User, Host FROM mysql.user;

********* FAIL2BAN *************
sudo systemctl restart fail2ban
sudo fail2ban-client status ssh
sudo iptables -L -n
sudo tail -f /var/log/fail2ban.log


FAIL2BAN IS: a log-parsing application that scans log files for specific patterns of failed login attempts and temporarily bans the IP addresses responsible for these attempts. The ban can be either in the form of a firewall rule or by rejecting connections from the IP address. This helps to prevent brute-force attacks and protect the system from unauthorized access.
